This enhances the flavor of the fish.\n   - **Bite**: Take the whole piece in one bite if possible, or if it's too large, take a big bite to keep the balance of fish and rice.\n\n3. **Ginger**: The green item on the plate is likely pickled ginger (gari). It's used to cleanse your palate between different types of sushi, so eat a small piece between different types if you wish.\n\n4. **Enjoy**: Sushi is best enjoyed fresh, so eat it soon after it's served.

{"example_id": "vibe-eval/difficulty-normal/misc17", "category": "difficulty-normal", "prompt": "describe the rule of this sport like I am 8 year old", "reference": "The sport being played in the image is baseball, which is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each. The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around a series of bases, while the opposing team tries to prevent this by getting three outs per half-inning.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- The Teams: There are two teams in baseball. One team bats (they try to hit the ball), and the other team fields (they try to catch it and get the hitters out).\n- The Game Starts: The game begins when a pitcher from the fielding team throws the ball towards the hitter from the batting team. The hitter tries to hit the ball with a bat.\n- Hitting the Ball: When the hitter hits the ball, they need to run to at least the first of four bases on the field. The bases are in a square shape and are called first, second, third, and home plate.\n- Running the Bases: The aim for the hitter is to run around all the bases back to home plate without getting out. If they make it back to home plate after hitting the ball, they score a run (a point).\n- Getting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the hitter out by catching the ball in the air before it touches the ground, or by touching the base before the hitter gets there when they have the ball.\n- Three Outs, Switch!: Each team gets to hit until they make three outs. Then, the teams switch roles – the hitters become fielders, and the fielders become hitters.\n- Innings: A part of the game that includes both teams getting a turn to hit and field is called an inning. A full game usually has nine innings.\n- Winning the Game: The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game wins!", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_misc17_8e3edb121303f324.jpg", "generation": "Hey there!

The person who throws the ball is called the pitcher, and the person who tries to hit it is the batter.\n\n4. **Scoring**: The goal is to hit the ball and run around the bases to get back to home plate. Every time you make it back to home plate, you score a point called a \"run\".\n\n5. **Outs**: If the other team catches the ball before it hits the ground, or if they throw the ball to a base before you get there, you're out. You need three outs to switch from batting to fielding.\n\n6. **Innings**: The game is divided into parts called innings. Each team gets a turn to bat and a turn to field in each inning. There are usually 9 innings in a game.\n\n7. **Winning**: The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins!\n\nSo, it's like a big game of tag with a ball and bat, where you try to run around the bases without getting tagged out.

Here is a recommended order for your morning routine:\n\n1. **Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser**: Start by cleansing your face to remove any impurities and prepare your skin for the following products.\n\n2. **Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**: Apply the exfoliant after cleansing. BHA (beta hydroxy acid) is great for unclogging pores and reducing the appearance of acne and fine lines. Leave it on for a few minutes before proceeding to the next step.\n\n3. *** Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**:  If you use a toner, like the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, it should be applied after exfoliating.\n\n4. **Eucerin Sun Fluid Photoaging Control SPF 50**: Apply sunscreen as the final step in your morning routine. This will protect your skin from harmful UV rays and prevent photoaging. It's essential to apply sunscreen every morning, regardless of whether you plan to be outdoors.\n\n5. **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Illumination with SPF 50**: You can also apply the CC cream over your sunscreen. This product provides color correction, coverage, and additional sun protection. It can be used as a makeup base or on its own.\n\nYour morning skincare routine should typically avoid products that could increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight or that are best used when your skin is in repair mode, which is generally during the night.\n\nBased on the products you've shown:\n\n- Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant: While it is fine to use a BHA exfoliant in the morning, it's essential to follow up with sunscreen because BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Since you have a sunscreen in your lineup, this should be okay for morning use as long as you protect your skin.\n\n- Eucerin Sun Protection: This should definitely be used in your morning routine to protect your skin from UV damage throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key in the morning is to focus on protection from the sun and environmental pollutants. So, sunscreen is a must-have in your morning routine.

Serums are typically applied after cleansing because they deliver active ingredients directly to the skin.\n\n3. **Moisturizer with SPF**: Follow with the **Eucerin Sun Face Oil Control SPF 50+**. This provides hydration and sun protection, which is crucial in the morning routine.\n\n4. **Additional Moisturizer (if needed)**: If your skin needs extra hydration, you can use the **It Cosmetics CC+ Cream**.

The image shows a man walking through an audience of people wearing virtual reality (VR) headsets. The man is identified as Mark Zuckerberg, known for being the CEO and founder of Facebook, which owns Oculus, a company that produces VR headsets. The text \"A Drug Dealer Never Consumes!\" is a play on words that compares Zuckerberg (the 'drug dealer') to the VR technology (the 'drug'), suggesting that he is providing the 'drug' (VR technology) but not 'consuming' it himself. The metaphor is that drug dealers typically do not use their own drugs, and in the same vein, Zuckerberg, as a promoter or provider of VR technology, is not seen using it in this image.", "media_filename": "difficulty-normal_meme4_c31bf46338434a19.jpg", "media_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/reka-annotate.appspot.com/vibe-eval/difficulty-normal_meme4_c31bf46338434a19.jpg", "generation": "This meme uses a humorous juxtaposition to make a point about hypocrisy or irony. Here's a breakdown of the elements:\n\n1. **Image**: The image shows a person walking in front of a large group of people who are all wearing virtual reality (VR) headsets. The person walking is not wearing a headset, while everyone else is deeply engaged in the virtual reality experience.\n\n2. **Text**: The text reads \"A Drug Dealer Never Consumes!\"\n\n**Explanation**:\n\n- **Drug Dealer Analogy**: The meme uses the analogy of a drug dealer, who typically does not consume the drugs they sell, to highlight a similar behavior in the context of technology or virtual reality.\n- **VR Users**: The people wearing VR headsets represent consumers who are deeply immersed in the virtual world, possibly to the point of being disconnected from reality.\n- **Person Walking**: The person walking, who is not wearing a VR headset, represents the \"drug dealer\" in this analogy. This person is likely involved in creating, promoting, or selling the VR technology but does not partake in it themselves.\n\n**Interpretation**:\n\nThe meme suggests that those who create or promote immersive technologies like VR might not use them themselves, similar to how a drug dealer might not use the drugs they sell. It implies a level of detachment or awareness from the creators or promoters, who might see the potential downsides or choose not to engage in the same way as the consumers.

The tweet from Reka AI states that they have developed their best and most capable multimodal language model yet, implying that despite limited resources or challenging conditions (metaphorically, a \"cave with a box of scraps\"), they were able to create something impressive.

Both responses highlight the themes of ingenuity, resourcefulness, and achievement under challenging conditions.\n\nRating: 4/5\nExplanation for the rating: The assistant response closely aligns with the ground truth but mistakenly references \"The Dark Knight\" instead of \"Iron Man,\" which is the actual source of the \"built in a cave with a box of scraps\" trope.
